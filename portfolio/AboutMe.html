        <div class="container">
            <p>I'm Nathaniel Dodson, a junior-year Software Engineering student at BYU–Idaho with a strong passion for
                games, systems, and software design. I’ve always been fascinated by how games work under the hood,
                especially the mechanics and design principles that make them engaging. While I hope to work in the game
                development industry someday, I'm equally excited by opportunities in broader software fields that
                involve creative problem-solving and system design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m most comfortable in Python and C#, and have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also
                worked with Java, C++, SQL, and engine-specific languages like GDScript (Godot).
                <br>
                <br>
                My projects range from gameplay prototypes to scripting tools and utilities, several of which are
                featured on the Projects page of this site.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether it’s building interactive systems or refining user experiences, I love the challenge of turning
                ideas into something real and functional.
